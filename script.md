Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. 99% of you are MCP’ing wrong. Being an AI engineer myself I had to built 3 MCP servers last week and only 1 didn’t crash my system. This video? It’s my experience in MCP for you. We’ll break down MCP into 3 dead-simple levels—each with a real-world fix.

## Intro

### Level1 - Why MCP

Let’s imagine the stone age without MCP, building an agent was like fixing an Ikea furniture.

- Pick a model
- Structure data sources - PostgresSQL
- Retrieve context (RAG) - FAISS
- Collect action > Tools | API’s - JIRA, NOTION, DevOPS, Slack
- Custom implementation and prompt engineer

The next day you wake up  and Mr Sammy and Musky came up with a new algorithm, you AI APP is so old that even the romans woudn’t use it.

HERE comes MCP

- Install mcp (add MCP)
- Use

Point 1 that people are getting wrong - not API, not standardized

replacing all the custom steps but with a fixed protocol

It is a USB-C for AI capabilities for almost  every software system

But how excatly can it take off 5 steps

### Level 2 - What is MCP

Think of MCP as the intelligent highway for AI to pick the best road.
